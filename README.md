# Demo
This Project is an application for a local pet store. The store needs to manage the names, types, and price of all pets. The requirements are:
·         Each pet at the shop should include the following attributes – name, type, price. For example: name:Max, type:dog, price:15
·         Get a specific pet
·         Get a list of pets (max limit of 100 returned)
·         Create a new pet
·         Update a pet (like its name or price change) 
·         Delete a pet
